# Scope Spring 2018: Backend, Node, and DevOps

This is the Scope Spring 2018 GitHub curriculum repository! Here you'll find projects and resources that will help you learn Node, Backend, and DevOps throughout the semester. Here you'll find a folder for every lesson. Within each folder is a project and a README.md that will guide you step-by-step on how to build the project for that lesson.

### Curriculum Outline
1. Lesson 0: Environment Set UP
2. Lesson 1: TBD
3. Lesson 2: TBD

### Using This Repo
To use this repo properly, first follow [lesson 0](lesson-0/README.md) to get Git, Node.js, and the right environment setup on your machine.

For every lesson, there's a project and a README.md that corresponds to that project. The project will contain the full finished code for that lesson and the README.md will walk you step-by-step on how to build that week's project from scratch.

We hope you'll follow along our curriculum and get started building Web apps. It's going to be a fun semester and we're glad you're a part of it!
