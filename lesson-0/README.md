# Lesson 0

Welcome to Scope - Spring 2018!

We're excited to get started teaching you about back-end, routes, and modern server side development!

Before we get started, we want to make sure everyone is on the same page regarding their environment and set up.

# Software

## Required

* Node (v9.x)
* NPM (v5.x)
* Browser (Chrome recommended)

Additionally, make sure you apply for the [GitHub Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), as it'll provide a lot of tools we'll use in deployment throughout the semester. 
## Recommended

Having a customized environment is one of the first steps to improving your workflow. We won't tell you exactly what you need to use, but these are some recommendations.

* WebStorm IDE - get through [JetBrains Student](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)
* Yarn (Facebook's replacement for NPM)
* Zsh (A bit more extendable than Bash, especially paired with Oh-My-Zsh)

# Getting Started

## Steps

1. If you're using WebStrom, simply open it and click "Import Project", and select the root of this folder (lesson-0). It should automatically get everything set up for you.

1a. If you choose to use a different IDE, simply open the project folder in that IDE. 

2. Open a shell and navigate to the folder `lesson-0`

3. Depending on your package manager, type `yarn install` or `npm install`. This will install all required modules and dependencies.

4. Run the server with `node bin/www` or with the green start button in the top right of WebStorm
